Replicating the first 11 figures in the following paper:

Watson, A. B. (2014). A formula for human retinal ganglion cell receptive field density as a function of visual field location. Journal of Vision, 14(7), 15-15.

Next step is to use this data to blur an img of high and low sf given the cone or RGC distributions at different retinal locations
