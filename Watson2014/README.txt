1. Replicate the first 11 figures in the following paper [check]:

Watson, A. B. (2014). A formula for human retinal ganglion cell receptive field density as a function of visual field location. Journal of Vision, 14(7), 15-15.

2. Extend to arbitrary retinal locations {x,y} [check]
equations 11-15 in paper

The original plan was to blur an image given photoreceptor densities, however, the math in the paper (11-15) applies to midget retinal ganglion cell receptive field spacing. This is what I have done so far. I am not sure the math holds for photoreceptor densities...perhaps if I can transform from density to spacing.
