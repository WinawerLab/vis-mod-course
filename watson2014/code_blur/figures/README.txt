figures before and after blur
first trying out a symmetrical blur (e.g. only using the temporal filter)
.
.
.
Proceeded to make 4 filters for each retinal location. Summed them to 
make one filter and convolved with a grating of and high and low sf.

I did this for cones densities and then for retinal ganglion cell
densities.

I first blur using cone filter than blur again using rgcd filter
