Here I will be replicating some of the math in the following paper:

Watson, A. B. (2014). A formula for human retinal ganglion cell receptive field density as a 
function of visual field location. Journal of Vision, 14(7), 15-15.

The goal is to then use this paper to downsample/blur an image to match density of cones
and/or retinal ganglion cells across temporal/nasal/superior/inferior retina
