Here I will be replicating some of the math in the following paper:
  Watson, A. B. (2014). A formula for human retinal ganglion cell 
  receptive field density as a function of visual 
  field location. Journal of Vision, 14(7), 15-15.

The goal is to then use this paper to downsample/blurr an image to 
match density of cones/retinal ganglion cells across temporal/nasal/superior/inferior retina
