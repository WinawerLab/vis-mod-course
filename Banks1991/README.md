# READ ME

This is the read me text file for the **Banks1991** folder, within the winawerlab/vis-mod-course github repository (https://github.com/WinawerLab/vis-mod-course/tree/master/Banks1991).

Code in this folder makes an attempt to reproduce spatial frequency limits as a function of eccentricity, for an ideal observer model (Figure 3 and 5) from the Banks et al. (1991) paper.
One can run the main analysis script to get results and run visualize results to plot figures.

This repository is Matlab based and uses the ISETBio toolbox (https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio).

There is a ToolboxToolbox registration file in the forked Winawerlab ToolboxRegistry (https://github.com/WinawerLab/ToolboxRegistry) called 'VisualModelingGradCourse'. If you use the ToolboxToolbox (https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox), you can type 
`tbUse('VisualModelingGradCourse')`
to add ISETBio and this code repository to your paths.




## Folder structure:

- banksRootPath.m 		: function to set paths, needs to be at highest level Banks folder
- figures 			: folder to save figures, content will be ignored by .gitignore
- functions 			: folder with sub functions called by the s_mainAnalysis script
- results			: folder to save results (d prime, per eccentricity, per cone segment), 
				  content will be ignored by .gitignore
- scripts 			: folder containing the two main scripts (and html code for published scripts):
					`s_mainAnalysis`
					`s_visualizeResults`		  	

## Future to doâ€™s:
- Look into differences ISETBio and Geisler computation of cone absorptions
- What target sizes are used for the stimuli at spatial frequencies and eccentricities not reported in table 1?
- Why is the ideal observer worse at the lowest spatial frequencies, compared to intermediate spatial frequencies?
- Implement retinal ganglion cell layer
- Implement option to simulate human observer results (computational observer model, add photon noise, human optics, etc)
