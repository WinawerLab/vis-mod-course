This script provides an implementation about how to present various
visual stimuli and how to use computational model to represent and 
analyze visual motion, using 'Spatiotemporal energy model', as described 
by Adelson & Bergen (1985) in 'Spatiotemporal Energy Models for the 
Perception of Motion' (JOSA-A,2:284-299).

This implementation tests four kinds of stimuli: impulse stimuli, drifting sinusoidal 
gratings, drifting bars, and drifting dots. Please refer to the "Adelson1985_tutorial" 
for a simple tutorial of the model (by applying impulse stimuli). For other types of 
stimuli, please refer to the file "trialDot" for drifting dot stimuli, "trialSin" for 
drifting sinusoidal grating and "trialBar" for drifting bar.
